Description: Node.js JavaScript runtime
 Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that 
 makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
